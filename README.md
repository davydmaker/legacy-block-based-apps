# Legacy Block-Based Mobile Apps

Repository containing legacy mobile app projects developed using block-based platforms like **MIT App Inventor**, **Kodular**, and **Thunkable**. Preserved for historical reference, learning purposes, and to document early problem-solving strategies in visual programming.

## Repository Structure

Projects are organized by development platform:

### MIT App Inventor
- `AtualizacaoAutomatica.aia` - Automatic update system
- `InstantMCPE.aia` - Application that linked to the InstantMCPE web page, which allowed creating a temporary Minecraft Pocket Edition server. It included other features such as server messages, commands, and other useful functionalities
- `MenuLateral.aia` - Example implementation of a side menu with screen switching

### Kodular
- `GalpaoDasArtes.aia` - Application for the Galpao das Artes cultural space
- `i9Ponto.aia` - Electronic time clock application that integrated with an API for employee time registration
- `nCOVID19_Aion.aia` - Application that integrated with an API containing COVID-19 data during the pandemic, in addition to safety tips
- `Project2D.aia`
- `SuperAnimes.aia` - Application for SuperAnimes, a well-known anime website (now defunct). The app opened the website internally and could control episode downloads
- `SuperAnimesLite.aia` - Lighter version of the SuperAnimes application

### Thunkable Classic
- `BotaoCompartilharWeb.aia`
- `LeitorCodigoBarrasQRCode.aia` - Barcode and QR Code reader

## About .aia Files

The `.aia` (App Inventor Archive) files are compressed archives that contain all components, visual code blocks, assets, and configuration settings of a project developed in block-based platforms. They can be imported directly into their respective platforms for viewing and editing.

> [!TIP]
> Although projects were developed in specific platforms, there is a high chance that when importing them into another compatible platform, they will work normally as well, due to the shared architecture and format of block-based development platforms.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- **Historical reference** - Documentation of projects developed in visual platforms
- **Learning material** - Practical examples of visual programming
- **Strategy documentation** - Record of early approaches to problem-solving
